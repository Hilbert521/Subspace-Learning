Original Paper: Deep neural network based subspace learning of robotic manipulator workspace mapping

## Abstract:
The manipulator workspace mapping is an important problem in robotics and has attracted significant attention in the community. Most of the pre-existing algorithms have expensive time complexity due to the reliance on sophisticated kinematic equations. In this paper, we introduce subspace learning (SL), a variant of subspace embedding, where a set of robot and scope parameters is mapped to the corresponding workspace by a deep neural network (DNN). Trained on a large dataset of around *6 /times 10^4* samples obtained from sampling designed uniform distributions, the experiments demonstrate that the embedding significantly reduces run-time complexity from *O(n^(36))* of traditional discretization method to *O(n^3)*, with high accuracies (average F-measure *0.9665*).
