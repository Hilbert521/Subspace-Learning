% Filtering a real-valued matrix into a bitmap
%
% outMatrix = ptFilter(inMatrix,n) returns a matrix outMatrix with the same
% size as inMatrix, where values larger than n are recorded as 1 while the
% remaining 0.
%
% Code tested on MATLAB R2017b. Usage independent from other functions is not recommended.
